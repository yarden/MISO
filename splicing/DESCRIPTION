Description: Various functions to study alternative splicing.
  Most importantly, the package contains a fast implementation 
  of the Mixture of Isoforms (MISO) isoform quantitation algorithm.
  It also supports gene visualization, checking whether
  isoform expression levels can be calculated for a given gene 
  structure, and a novel gene structure complexity measure.
