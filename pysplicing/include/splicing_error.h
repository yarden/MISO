 * <para>\a splicing functions can run into various problems preventing them 
 * from normal operation. The user might have supplied invalid arguments,
 * e.g. a non-square matrix when a square-matrix was expected, or the program 
 * has run out of memory while some more memory allocation is required, etc.
 * </para>
 * 
 * <para>By default \a splicing aborts the program when it runs into an 
 * error. While this behavior might be good enough for smaller programs, 
 * it is without doubt avoidable in larger projects. Please read further
 * if your project requires more sophisticated error handling. You can 
 * safely skip the rest of this chapter otherwise.

/**
 * \section errorhandlers Error handlers
 *
 * <para>
 * If \a splicing runs into an error - an invalid argument was supplied
 * to a function, or we've ran out of memory - the control is
 * transferred to the \emb error handler \eme function.
 * </para><para>
 * The default error handler is \ref splicing_error_handler_abort which
 * prints an error message and aborts the program.
 * </para>
 * <para>
 * The \ref splicing_set_error_handler() function can be used to set a new
 * error handler function of type \ref splicing_error_handler_t; see the
 * documentation of this type for details.
 * </para>
 * <para>
 * There are two other predefined error handler functions,
 * \ref splicing_error_handler_ignore and \ref splicing_error_handler_printignore.
 * These deallocate the temporarily allocated memory (more about this
 * later) and return with the error code. The latter also prints an
 * error message. If you use these error handlers you need to take
 * care about possible errors yourself by checking the return value of
 * (almost) every non-void \a splicing function.
 * </para><para>
 * Independently of the error handler installed, all functions in the
 * library do their best to leave their arguments
 * \em semantically unchanged if an error
 * happens. By semantically we mean that the implementation of an
 * object supplied as an argument might change, but its
 * \quote meaning \endquote in most cases does not. The rare occasions
 * when this rule is violated are documented in this manual.

 * 
 * <para>
 * You can write and install error handlers simply by defining a

 * \ref splicing_set_error_handler(). This feature is useful for interface
 * writers, as \a splicing will have the chance to

 * error handler which calls the <function>error()</function>
 * function, as required by R, while the Python interface has an error
 * handler which raises an exception according to the Python way.

 * splicing_error() function) the installed error handler. Another useful
 * macro is \ref SPLICING_CHECK(). This checks the return value of its

/** 
 * \section deallocating_memory Deallocating memory
 *
 * <para>
 * If a function runs into an error (and the program is not aborted)
 * the error handler should deallocate all temporary memory. This is
 * done by storing the address and the destroy function of all temporary
 * objects in a stack. The \ref SPLICING_FINALLY function declares an object as
 * temporary by placing its address in the stack. If an \a splicing function returns
 * with success it calls \ref SPLICING_FINALLY_CLEAN() with the
 * number of objects to remove from the stack. If an error happens
 * however, the error handler should call \ref SPLICING_FINALLY_FREE() to
 * deallocate each object added to the stack. This means that the
 * temporary objects allocated in the calling function (and etc.) will
 * be freed as well.
 * </para>
 */

/**
 * \section writing_functions_error_handling Writing \a splicing functions with
 * proper error handling
 *
 * <para>
 * There are some simple rules to keep in order to have functions
 * behaving well in erroneous situations. First, check the arguments
 * of the functions and call \ref SPLICING_ERROR if they are invalid. Second,
 * call \ref SPLICING_FINALLY on each dynamically allocated object and call
 * \ref SPLICING_FINALLY_CLEAN() with the proper argument before returning. Third, use
 * \ref SPLICING_CHECK on all \a splicing function calls which can generate errors.
 * </para>
 * <para>
 * The size of the stack used for this bookkeeping is fixed, and
 * small. If you want to allocate several objects, write a destroy
 * function which can deallocate all of these. See the
 * <filename>adjlist.c</filename> file in the
 * \a splicing source for an example.
